//
Simple-Card:

Simple-Card specifies audio DAI connections of SoC <-> codec.

Required properties:

- compatible				: "simple-audio-card"

Optional properties:

- simple-audio-card,name		: User specified audio sound card name, one string
					  property.
- simple-audio-card,widgets		: Please refer to widgets.txt.
- simple-audio-card,routing		: A list of the connections between audio components.
					  Each entry is a pair of strings, the first being the
					  connection's sink, the second being the connection's
					  source.
- simple-audio-card,mclk-fs             : Multiplication factor between stream rate and codec
					  mclk. When defined, mclk-fs property defined in
					  dai-link sub nodes are ignored.
- simple-audio-card,hp-det-gpio		: Reference to GPIO that signals when
					  headphones are attached.
- simple-audio-card,mic-det-gpio	: Reference to GPIO that signals when
					  a microphone is attached.
- simple-audio-card,aux-devs		: List of phandles pointing to auxiliary devices, such
					  as amplifiers, to be added to the sound card.
- simple-audio-card,pin-switches	: List of strings containing the widget names for
					  which pin switches must be created.

Optional subnodes:

- simple-audio-card,dai-link		: Container for dai-link level
					  properties and the CPU and CODEC
					  sub-nodes. This container may be
					  omitted when the card has only one
					  DAI link. See the examples and the
					  section below.
